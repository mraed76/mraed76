Hi! I'm Mo Alma, otherwise known as mraed76. I'm a 17-year-old student getting started on learning how to program!
Though I'm still a beginner, I aim to learn <b>everything</b> the Computer Science field offers. :)
I'm currently learning <i>HTML and CSS</i>, and I'm going to get started on <i>Java and C</i>.
